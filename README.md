# Javascript Fizzbuzz

## Description

* Problem: Write a stand-alone javascript program that iterates over the numbers 1 to 1000. For each number, your program should print each number, but substitute "fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "buzz" if it is divisible by 5, and "fizzbuzz" if it is divisible by both.

* Solution:
I did some review of js syntax at w3schools.com and basically knew where I was going from there.

I worked on my code in a jsfiddle, then set up the repo once it was working properly.
